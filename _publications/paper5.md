<!-- *Abstract* -- Dynamic optimization in which an objective function and constraints depend on time, has attracted more and more attention in scientific researches and engineering. In this work, we propose a nonlinear integral-augmented model based on zeroing neural network approach for dynamic convex optimization with affine constraints. The gap between the model state and optimum, i.e., optimality gap, vanishes in finite time and the optimal solution is thus tracked successfully online. In addition to global finite-time convergence, we also prove that the model is capable of adaptation to an important kind of noises that we call error-related noise. Compared with other existing models in numerical experiments, our model manifests better robustness under noise contamination. Finally, on the basis of our model, we develop a model-free control framework for a surgical manipulator with the remote-center-of-motion constraint. In simulations, the proposed model outperforms other present models likewise.  -->
